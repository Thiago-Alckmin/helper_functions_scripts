# helper_functions_scripts
 
I created this mostly so that I can have an easily accessible repository of helper functions for all of my projects. 
I would like to develop this into a package, as I think there is a treassure trove of functions here that regular R users would love, but the hassle of making a package (and having to deal with data.table inconsistencies when converting it into a package) made me relegate them to a simple R script. 

Please reach out if you are interested in helping convert this into a package or have any tips on how to improve my funciton's performance!
